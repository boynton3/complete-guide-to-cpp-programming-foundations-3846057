Global Variables:
    - global variables since same indentation as main()
    - global variables are accessible by all areas of the code
    - memory of global variables is handled statically by the compiler so allocated in data segment of memory
    - once program ends, memory is freed
    - best practice is to avoid global variables when possible

int a, b = 5;

int main(){
    /*
    Local Variables/automatic variables:
        - variables defined inside functions or loops are local to their scope and not accessible outside 
        - variables deleted and memory freed once execution exits scope
        - managed by the compiler and allocated in the stack segment of memory (stack segment is temporary)

   bool my_flag;
   a = 7;
   //note that flase is encoded as 0 in c++
   my_flag = false;
   std::cout << "a = " << a << std::endl;
   std::cout << "b = " << b << std::endl;
   std::cout << "flag = " << my_flag << std::endl;

   //code to toggle the flag and print out expressions

   // answer is 2^32 - 2 which is 2 represented in binary. The binary number is the same but interpretation is different.
